# About

This is the suplementary repository for the CCS24 paper titled "Oblivious Digital Tokens".

# Usage

Before you can open the proof files, you must install [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.com/).

Once installed, start an interactive Tamarin session in the folder with the proof file by calling:
```
tamarin-prover interactive .
```
After some time, this will open a local webserver that you can access by going to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`

Clicking on the `out.spthy` file will load the completed proofs.
